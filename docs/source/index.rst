Welcome to high level synthesizable VHDL project (hVHDL) documentation!
===================================

**hVHDL** is a set of coding patterns for standard VHDL that are designed to greatly increase abstraction level of VHDL source code using standard synthesis tools. The coding patterns are designed to support incremental design, testing and development of the VHDL source code. All code has been tested with an FPGA using Xilinx Vivado, ISE, Intel Quartus or Efinix Efinity tools.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
