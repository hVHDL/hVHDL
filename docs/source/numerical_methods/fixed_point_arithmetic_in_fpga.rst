Doing mathematics on FPGA
=========================

When we talk about numbers, we mostly refer to real numbers. These are numbers like 3.5, 5.0 7.182746813756 and 0.0. Real numbers are those that we use when we calculate things. When computers to arithmetic, they always use binary. This is regardless whether we have fixed or floating point arithmetic, the number system what is saved on the registers are binary.

In binary we have two common ways to represent numbers. These are sign-magnitude and two's complement. The difference in these is how we interpreted negative numbers.


Fixed point numbers

Fixed point number system is the simplest way to do math in FPGA. The
