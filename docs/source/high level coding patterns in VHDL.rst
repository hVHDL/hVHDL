High Level Coding Patterns in synthesizable VHDL
================================================

The main things that make up of a high level coding pattern is abstraction.

Creating callable object with records and subroutines
-----------------------------------------------------

Creating objects from objects
-----------------------------

Simple state machines
---------------------

We should strive for making only linear state machines. Here we will show how to achieve arbitrarily complex begavior with only linear state machines
