example of a high level vhdl use
================================

There is an example project that includes build scripts for building the project using Efinix Efinity, Lattice Diamond, Intel Quartus, Xilinx ISE/PlanAhead and Xilinx Vivado.

The project can be used as an example how to include and use hVHDL sources to your own project. The project uses uart, multiplier, sine, interconnecting bus, a floating point math and memory.

see example here(implementation will be added soon) :
